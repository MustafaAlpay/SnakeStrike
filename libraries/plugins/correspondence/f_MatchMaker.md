brief: This function is part of the plugin API. The functions are defined by a generic interface so that many different types of cameras can work with SnakeStrike and so that new cameras can use SnakeStrike without requiring re-compilation of the SnakeStrike codebase. More specifically, this function is a wrapper for the functions that the user can provide regarding how to assign points across cameras and across timesteps.
