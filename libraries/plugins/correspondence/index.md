brief: Code that handles the assignment problem. How should one go about assigning points that are detected in the images. One needs to disambiguate the points from other points when viewed through the different cameras. Furthermore, one must reliably keep track of these points across subsequent timesteps. If both of these are not accomplished, the reconstruction will be fairly useless.
